🚦 Advanced Traffic Control System  

📖 Overview  

The Advanced Traffic Control System is an AI-powered, IoT-enabled, and blockchain-secured solution designed to revolutionize urban traffic management. Traditional traffic systems rely on fixed signal timings, which fail to adapt to real-time traffic conditions, leading to congestion, longer travel times, increased fuel consumption, and environmental pollution. This project integrates AI-driven traffic prediction, IoT sensors for real-time data collection, and dynamic lane allocation to optimize traffic flow, reduce delays, and improve overall efficiency.  

🔹 Key Features  

✅ AI-Based Adaptive Traffic Signals – Uses machine learning TensorFlow to adjust signal durations dynamically based on vehicle density.  
✅ Real-Time Traffic Monitoring – IoT cameras and sensors track traffic congestion and pedestrian movement.  
✅ Dynamic Lane Allocation – Smart LED road markings and variable message signs adjust lane configurations in real time.  
✅ Emergency Vehicle Prioritization – RFID and GPS tracking ensure ambulances and fire trucks get priority at intersections.  
✅ Blockchain for Secure Data Sharing – Ensures tamper-proof, decentralized storage of traffic data.  
✅ Cloud-Based Predictive Analytics – AI-driven forecasting optimizes traffic signals based on historical and real-time data.  
✅ Traffic Control Dashboard – A React.js-based UI designed in Figma provides real-time monitoring and manual control for traffic authorities.
